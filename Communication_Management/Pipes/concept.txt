⭐ 1. What is a PIPE?

A pipe is a one-way communication channel between processes.

Think of a pipe as:

✔ A queue inside the kernel
✔ One process writes → other process reads
✔ Unidirectional (one direction only)
✔ Uses file descriptors (FDs)




| FD      | Meaning   |
| ------- | --------- |
| `fd[0]` | Read end  |
| `fd[1]` | Write end |



int fd[2];
pipe(fd);

After this:
fd[0] → READ
fd[1] → WRITE

Both ends exist inside the same process, but after fork():
Parent can write
Child can read
Or vice-versa




⭐ 3. Pipe Mechanism

Process A (writer) ---> [ pipe buffer in kernel ] ---> Process B (reader)
The kernel maintains:
a circular buffer
blocking behavior
synchronization
atomic writes up to PIPE_BUF size



⭐ 4. Blocking Rules
✔ If pipe is EMPTY → read() BLOCKS
✔ If pipe is FULL → write() BLOCKS
✔ If write end is closed → read() returns 0 (EOF)
✔ If read end is closed → write() causes SIGPIPE

⭐ 1. What is a Socket?

A socket is a communication endpoint.

It allows:

Two processes to talk
Two machines to talk
One-to-one or one-to-many communication

A socket works like:
process A <---- socket ----> process B


Can be on:

✔ Same machine
✔ Different machine
✔ Different network




🔵 A) UNIX Domain Sockets (Local IPC)


Very fast
Uses a file path like /tmp/mysock
No network protocol
Used between local processes
Functions same as TCP sockets but no networking.





🔵 B) INTERNET Sockets (Network IPC)

Used for communication across network.

Two types:
1️⃣ TCP Sockets (SOCK_STREAM)
Reliable
Ordered
Connection-oriented
Used for web servers, ssh, chat apps

2️⃣ UDP Sockets (SOCK_DGRAM)
Unreliable
Fast
No connection
Used for games, VoIP, video streaming





| Function    | Purpose           |
| ----------- | ----------------- |
| `socket()`  | create socket     |
| `bind()`    | assign address    |
| `listen()`  | wait for client   |
| `accept()`  | accept client     |
| `connect()` | connect to server |
| `send()`    | send data         |
| `recv()`    | receive data      |
| `close()`   | close socket      |




⭐ 4. CLIENT–SERVER MODEL 

Server steps:
socket()
bind()
listen()
accept()
read()/write()
close()


Client steps:
socket()
connect()
read()/write()
close()




| Feature     | UNIX Socket | TCP          | UDP                    |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------ | ---------------------- |
| IPC         | Yes         | No           | No                     |
| Network     | No          | Yes          | Yes                    |
| Speed       | Fastest     | Medium       | Fastest but unreliable |
| Reliability | High        | Very High    | Low                    |
| Use case    | Local IPC   | Web, servers | Games, DNS             |

⭐ 1. What is Shared Memory?

Shared memory is an IPC mechanism where two or more processes share the same RAM region.

Meaning:

✔ One process writes into memory
✔ Another process reads from the SAME memory
✔ No copying
✔ Full speed

Shared memory is used when large data must be shared fast.




⭐ 2. Why Shared Memory is the FASTEST IPC?

Because:
❌ Pipes, FIFOs, sockets → copy data twice

User → kernel
Kernel → user

✔ Shared memory → NO COPY
Both processes use same memory segment, mapped directly.

This makes it fastest and best for large data.




| Function   | Purpose                      |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- |
| `shmget()` | create shared memory segment |
| `shmat()`  | attach to process            |
| `shmdt()`  | detach                       |
| `shmctl()` | control/delete               |





| Function       | Purpose                     |
| -------------- | --------------------------- |
| `shm_open()`   | create shared memory object |
| `ftruncate()`  | set memory size             |
| `mmap()`       | map into memory             |
| `munmap()`     | unmap                       |
| `shm_unlink()` | delete                      |

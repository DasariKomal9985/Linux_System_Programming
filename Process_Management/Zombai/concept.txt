⭐ 1. What is a Zombie Process?

A zombie process is a child process that:

✔ has finished execution
✔ but its parent has NOT called wait() or waitpid()
✔ so the kernel keeps its entry in the process table
✔ showing <defunct> in ps

The process is DEAD, but still occupies a PID.



⭐ 2. WHY does a Zombie process exist?

Because Linux must save:
exit status
return code
how the child terminated
for the parent to read via wait().
Until parent collects this information:

👉 child stays as zombie
👉 kernel cannot remove PCB
👉 parent must call wait() to clean it





⭐ 3. What a Zombie CANNOT do

Zombies:

cannot run code
cannot use CPU
cannot do system calls
cannot respond
cannot consume memory
cannot be killed by kill -9
Because they are already DEAD.
Zombies only occupy:
1 PID
small kernel structure (process table slot)




⭐ 4. Why Zombies are Dangerous?

If many zombies pile up:

✔ system might run out of PIDs
✔ process table becomes full
✔ system becomes unstable

This is why good programs must ALWAYS call wait().




⭐ 5. IDENTIFYING Zombies

ps -ef | grep defunct

[a.out] <defunct>

Z    0:00  [a.out]

ps aux | grep Z



Parent
  |
  |-- fork()
      |
      +-- Child starts → running
                 |
              exit()
                 ↓
         Kernel keeps child as zombie
                 ↓
         Parent MUST call wait()
                 ↓
         Kernel removes zombie entry





⭐ 10. How to avoid zombies (3 methods)
🟩 1. Use wait() or waitpid()

Parent cleans child.

🟧 2. Parent catches SIGCHLD

Signal handler automatically removes child.

🟥 3. Child becomes orphan → adopted by init/systemd

init always waits for children → no zombie.
This is why orphans DO NOT become zombies.

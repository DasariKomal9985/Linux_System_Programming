⭐ 1. What is a Race Condition?

A race condition happens when:

✔ Two or more processes/threads
✔ TRY TO ACCESS OR MODIFY THE SAME SHARED RESOURCE
✔ AT THE SAME TIME
✔ And the final result depends on who runs first (the race)

So the output becomes:

❌ unpredictable
❌ inconsistent
❌ wrong
❌ random behavior




⭐ 2. Why does a race condition happen?

Because the OS scheduler runs threads in unknown order.

Two threads modify the same variable:
x = 0

Thread 1 → x = x + 1
Thread 2 → x = x + 1


x = 2


1  (lost update)


x = x + 1


It involves:

Load x
Add 1
Store x
If both threads load x BEFORE any stores happen → both write the same value → one increment is lost.




⭐ 3. Real-world analogy (very easy)
🛒 Two people withdrawing from the same bank account

Balance = 1000
Person A wants to withdraw 700
Person B wants to withdraw 700

If both check balance at the SAME TIME → both see 1000 → both withdraw → account becomes –400 (incorrect).

This is a race condition.



⭐ 4. Real Linux Example (dangerous)

Two processes writing to the same file without locking:

Process 1 → write "hello"
Process 2 → write "komal"


Output file may become:

hekomallo

This corruption is a race condition.

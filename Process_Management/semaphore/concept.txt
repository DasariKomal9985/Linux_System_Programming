⭐ 1. What is a Semaphore?

A semaphore is a synchronization tool used to:

✔ Control access to shared resources
✔ Avoid race conditions
✔ Allow multiple threads/processes to coordinate
✔ Implement signaling between threads

A semaphore holds a counter, which represents how many threads can access a resource.





⭐ 2. Types of Semaphores

There are two main types:

🔵 1. Binary Semaphore (0/1)

Value is either 0 or 1
Works like a mutex
Used for mutual exclusion

🔵 2. Counting Semaphore

Value can be 0 to N
Allows N threads to access a resource
Useful for:
producer–consumer
thread pools
limiting connections




⭐ 3. Semaphore Operations 


✔ sem_wait(&sem)
Decrease semaphore
If sem == 0 → thread BLOCKS
If sem > 0 → thread continues

✔ sem_post(&sem)
Increase semaphore

Unblocks waiting threads

✔ sem_init()
Create semaphore with initial value

✔ sem_destroy()
Free resources




| Feature   | Semaphore                   | Mutex                     |
| --------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Value     | 0..N                        | 0 or 1                    |
| Ownership | Can be posted by ANY thread | ONLY owner can unlock     |
| Purpose   | Signaling + counting        | Mutual exclusion          |
| blocking  | sem_wait blocks             | pthread_mutex_lock blocks |
| Type      | OS synchronization          | Thread locking            |

⭐ 1. What is a Mutex?

MUTEX = MUTual EXclusion

A mutex ensures:

✔ Only ONE thread can enter the critical section
✔ Protects shared data
✔ Prevents race conditions
✔ Provides locking mechanism

A mutex is like putting a lock on a room → only one person (thread) can enter at a time.



⭐ 2. How Mutex Works Internally

A mutex has two states:
locked (1)
unlocked (0)
When a thread calls:

✔ pthread_mutex_lock(&m);
If mutex is unlocked → thread enters and mutex becomes locked
If mutex is locked → thread blocks (waits)
When thread finishes critical section:

✔ pthread_mutex_unlock(&m);
Releases lock
Next waiting thread wakes up



| Function                  | Meaning                 |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `pthread_mutex_init()`    | create mutex            |
| `pthread_mutex_destroy()` | destroy mutex           |
| `pthread_mutex_lock()`    | lock (block until free) |
| `pthread_mutex_trylock()` | try lock (non-blocking) |
| `pthread_mutex_unlock()`  | unlock                  |




| Feature   | Mutex                 | Semaphore            |
| --------- | --------------------- | -------------------- |
| Value     | 0 or 1                | 0 to N               |
| Ownership | ONLY owner can unlock | anyone can post      |
| Purpose   | mutual exclusion      | signaling + counting |
| Blocking  | lock waits            | sem_wait waits       |
| Type      | locking primitive     | signaling primitive  |

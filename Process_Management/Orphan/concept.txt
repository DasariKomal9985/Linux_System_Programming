⭐ WHAT IS AN ORPHAN PROCESS?

A process becomes ORPHAN when:
Its parent dies first
But child is still running
When this happens:

👉 The kernel automatically reassigns the child’s parent to init (PID = 1) or systemd.
This prevents child processes from becoming zombies.





⭐ Why does orphan happen?


Parent forks a child
Parent exits immediately
Child is still running
Child has NO parent now → becomes orphan
Kernel assigns parent = init/systemd
init/systemd waits for the child when it ends
So no zombie is created

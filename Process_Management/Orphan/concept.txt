⭐ WHAT IS AN ORPHAN PROCESS?

A process becomes ORPHAN when:
Its parent dies first
But child is still running
When this happens:

👉 The kernel automatically reassigns the child’s parent to init (PID = 1) or systemd.
This prevents child processes from becoming zombies.





⭐ Why does orphan happen?


Parent forks a child
Parent exits immediately
Child is still running
Child has NO parent now → becomes orphan
Kernel assigns parent = init/systemd
init/systemd waits for the child when it ends
So no zombie is created



| Property                         | Meaning                           |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Parent dies first                | Child becomes orphan              |
| New Parent = init/systemd        | PID 1 adopts the child            |
| No zombie is created             | Because init/systemd waits for it |
| Child continues running normally | No interruption                   |





Original:
Parent (PID 1000)
   └── Child (PID 1001)

Parent dies → Child becomes orphan

After re-parenting:
init (PID 1)
   └── Child (PID 1001)




⭐ WHY Linux RE-PARENTS ORPHAN CHILDREN?

To prevent zombies.
If child didn’t get a new parent:
when it exits, NO ONE would call wait()
that would cause a zombie forever
So Linux uses init/systemd to clean them up.

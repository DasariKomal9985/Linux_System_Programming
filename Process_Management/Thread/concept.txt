⭐ 1. What is a Thread?

A thread is:

✔ A lightweight execution unit inside a process
✔ Shares same memory with other threads

✔ Each thread has its own:

Stack
Program counter
Registers

But all threads inside a process share:

Code section
Data section
Heap memory
File descriptors

This is why threads are fast and memory-efficient.
